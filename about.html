  <h1>Introduction: A Growing Water Challenges</h1>

  <p><span style="color:red">Egypt is currently facing a serious water crisis caused by several growing challenges.</span> One of the main reasons is the rapid population growth, which increases the demand for water in homes, farms, and industries. At the same time, climate change is making things worse by causing higher temperatures and less predictable rainfall, which leads to more water loss through evaporation. Pollution is also a major issue, as factories and untreated sewage are polluting the Nile, making the water unsafe for use. Additionally, projects in upstream countries, like Ethiopia’s Grand Renaissance Dam, are threatening the flow of the Nile into Egypt. Since more than 90% of Egypt’s freshwater comes from the Nile, any change in its flow puts the country’s water security at great risk.</p>

  <h1>Water in Islam</h1>
  <p>Islam highly values water as a blessing from Allah and teaches people not to waste it. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) advised using only what is needed even when water is abundant.</p>

  <h2>Islamic Teachings on Water</h2>
  <p>Water holds a very special place in Islam. It is seen as a gift from Allah and a source of life and purity. The Qur'an emphasizes the importance of water in many verses. One powerful verse says:

"وَجَعَلْنَا مِنَ الْمَاءِ كُلَّ شَيْءٍ حَيٍّ"
(Surah Al-Anbiya 21:30)  
“And We made from water every living thing.”

This shows how water is essential for all forms of life. Islam also teaches Muslims to use water wisely and avoid wasting it, even when it is available in abundance. The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:

"لا تسرف في الماء ولو كنت على نهر جارٍ"  
“Do not waste water, even if you are at a flowing river.”  
(حديث صحيح رواه ابن ماجه)

Water is not just for survival, but also used in worship, such as wudu (ablution) before prayers. This shows the spiritual and practical value of water in Islam. It reminds Muslims to be grateful for water and protect it as a blessing from Allah.
